Profit after tax 7,116 5,649 26.0Condensed income statement, Audi GroupThe Audi Group generated revenue of EUR 
61,753 (53,068) million in the 2022 fiscal year. The 16.4 percent increase compared with 
the previous year despite an almost constant number of vehicles sold was due to strong price enforcement as well as to the first-time consolidation of the Bentley brand as of January 1, 2022.
Revenue from the sale of cars of the Audi brand in-
creased to EUR 41,081 (36,476) million. In particular, the fully electric models Audi Q4 e-tron, Audi e-tron and Audi e-tron GT¹ posted strong year-on-year sales growth. The Audi A3 and Audi Q5 model lines also made a substantial contribution to revenue growth. During the reporting period, the Lamborghini brand  increased revenue from the vehicle business by 20.6 Financial

percent to EUR 2,193 (1,818) million. The Bentley brand recorded revenue from the vehicle business of EUR 3,300 million, while the Ducati brand also posted a record figure of EUR 917 (738) million. 
The other revenue of the Audi Group was notice- 
ably higher than in the prior-year period at EUR 15,008 (14,089) million. The main reason for this was, above all, increased revenue from sales of genuine parts and engines. This was countered by slightly lower income from parts deliveries to China. 
In the year under review, revenue by region gave 
a positive picture. For example, the Premium brand group posted very strong revenue growth of 44.4  percent in the USA, to EUR 12,706 (8,801) million.  
While revenue in Europe also increased to  Financial performance
EUR 30,460 (26,936) million, in China² it remained  virtually unchanged from the previous year at  EUR 11,081 (11,230) million. 
Cost of goods sold increased, mainly due to high-
er expenses for production materials and procurement. Alongside the first-time consolidation of Bentley, the primary reasons for this were the higher proportion of electric vehicles sold and the increase in commodity and parts prices in the year under review.

performance and strong brands, net cash flow at a high level.

In the 2022 fiscal year, the Audi Group generated 
cash flow from operating activities of EUR 10,028 (11,471) million. 
The year-on-year decline despite the increased profit was especially attributable to higher income tax pay-ments and the negative change in working capital. This was mainly due to the increase in trade receivables  resulting from higher volume sales at year-end and  increased inventories as a consequence of the im-proved supply situation in particular and also because of logistics delays. The increase in trade payables had a positive effect on working capital while lower provi-sions had a negative impact. 
Investing activities attributable to operating activities

The Statements of Cash Flows of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG according to the German Commercial Code 
(HGB) are drawn up in line with the German accounting 
standard DRS 21. In an exception to DRS 21, dividends 
from subsidiaries as well as intra-Group offsetting of  
services from corporate functions are presented in Cash 
Flow from operating activities even when they are offset 
by means of cash pooling procedures. The same applies 
to capital increases and capital repayments from subsidi-
aries being presented in Cash Flow from investing activi-
ties. An offsetting recognition of cash pooling procedures takes place in Cash Flow from financing activities.Cash flow from operating activities resulted in a net 
cash outflow of €1.9 billion in 2022 (2021: cash inflow of 
€3.3 billion). The decrease compared to the previous year 
was due in particular to lower distributions from subsidi-
aries. Furthermore tax payments increased by €1.7 billion 
compared to the previous year.
Cash flow from investing activities resulted in a net 
cash inflow of €1.6 billion in 2022 (2021: cash outflow  of €1.0 billion). The cash inflow was due in particular to 
the acquisitions and disposals of securities within the 
context of liquidity management (2022: €1.1 billion, 2021: cash outflow of €1.2 billion). Additionally corporate 
restructuring associated with the spin-off and hive-down 
of the Daimler commercial vehicle business had nega-
tively impacted the cash flow from investing activities in 
2021. Capital repayments and disposals of subsidiaries 
had had an opposing, positively effect on the cash flow 
in the previous year.
Cash flow from financing activities resulted in a  
net cash outflow of €1.3 billion in the reporting period 
(2021: €0.9 billion). The change is explained by the higher 
dividend payment to the shareholders of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG and the increased repayment of external 
financing liabilities. On the other side the financing pro-
vided to subsidiaries in connection with central financial 
and liquidity management resulted in a positive effect on 
cash flow from financing activities.
Equity increased by €3.6 billion to €37.0 billion in 2022. 
This increase was a result of the net profit amounting to 
€8.9 billion, of which €3.3 billion was transferred to 
retained earnings pursuant to Section 58 Subsection 2  
of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). On the other 
hand, equity decreased by €5.3 billion due to the divi-
dend payment to the shareholders of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG. The equity ratio as of the reporting date was 
43.9% (2021: 40.3%). Mercedes-Benz Group AG held no 
treasury shares as of 31 December 2022.
Provisions increased by €1.2 billion to €3.1 billion. This 
was mainly due to the increase in provisions for contin-
gent losses resulting from derivative financial instru-
ments, income taxes and pension obligations.
Liabilities decreased by €3.4 billion to €44.2 billion.  
This was mainly due to the decrease of bonds in the 
amount of €6.6 billion. However, liabilities to subsidiaries 
increased by €3.3 billion.",mercedes-benz-annual-report-2022-incl-combined-management-report-mbg-ag.pdf,page_0,2022,Automotive,Mercedes,annual report,

had had an opposing, positively effect on the cash flow 
in the previous year.
Cash flow from financing activities resulted in a  
net cash outflow of €1.3 billion in the reporting period 
(2021: €0.9 billion). The change is explained by the higher 
dividend payment to the shareholders of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG and the increased repayment of external 
financing liabilities. On the other side the financing pro-
vided to subsidiaries in connection with central financial 
and liquidity management resulted in a positive effect on 
cash flow from financing activities.
Equity increased by €3.6 billion to €37.0 billion in 2022. 
This increase was a result of the net profit amounting to 
€8.9 billion, of which €3.3 billion was transferred to 
retained earnings pursuant to Section 58 Subsection 2  
of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). On the other 
hand, equity decreased by €5.3 billion due to the divi-
dend payment to the shareholders of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG. The equity ratio as of the reporting date was 
43.9% (2021: 40.3%). Mercedes-Benz Group AG held no 
treasury shares as of 31 December 2022.
Provisions increased by €1.2 billion to €3.1 billion. This 
was mainly due to the increase in provisions for contin-
gent losses resulting from derivative financial instru-
ments, income taxes and pension obligations.
Liabilities decreased by €3.4 billion to €44.2 billion.  
This was mainly due to the decrease of bonds in the 
amount of €6.6 billion. However, liabilities to subsidiaries 
increased by €3.3 billion.",mercedes-benz-annual-report-2022-incl-combined-management-report-mbg-ag.pdf,page_0,2022,Automotive,Mercedes,annual report,

The Statements of Cash Flows of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG according to the German Commercial Code 
(HGB) are drawn up in line with the German accounting 
standard DRS 21. In an exception to DRS 21, dividends 
from subsidiaries as well as intra-Group offsetting of  
services from corporate functions are presented in Cash 
Flow from operating activities even when they are offset 
by means of cash pooling procedures. The same applies 
to capital increases and capital repayments from subsidi-
aries being presented in Cash Flow from investing activi-
ties. An offsetting recognition of cash pooling procedures takes place in Cash Flow from financing activities.Cash flow from operating activities resulted in a net 
cash outflow of €1.9 billion in 2022 (2021: cash inflow of 
€3.3 billion). The decrease compared to the previous year 
was due in particular to lower distributions from subsidi-
aries. Furthermore tax payments increased by €1.7 billion 
compared to the previous year.
Cash flow from investing activities resulted in a net 
cash inflow of €1.6 billion in 2022 (2021: cash outflow  of €1.0 billion). The cash inflow was due in particular to 
the acquisitions and disposals of securities within the 
context of liquidity management (2022: €1.1 billion, 2021: cash outflow of €1.2 billion). Additionally corporate 
restructuring associated with the spin-off and hive-down 
of the Daimler commercial vehicle business had nega-
tively impacted the cash flow from investing activities in 
2021. Capital repayments and disposals of subsidiaries 
had had an opposing, positively effect on the cash flow 
in the previous year.
Cash flow from financing activities resulted in a  
net cash outflow of €1.3 billion in the reporting period 
(2021: €0.9 billion). The change is explained by the higher 
dividend payment to the shareholders of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG and the increased repayment of external
